KeepNaSampEn <- function(x, m, r)
# Run the C function in mseLong.c file to perform a multiscale entropy (MSE)
# analysis of a regularly spaced time series.  Return the results as an
# R data frame.

# ARGUMENTS
#  x : A numeric vector, with data for a regularly spaced time series.  NA's
#      are not allowed (because the C program is not set up to handle them).
#  tau : Vector of scale factors to use for MSE.  Scale factors are positive
#      integers that specify bin size for the MSE algorithm:  the number of
#      consecutive observations in 'x' that form a bin and are averaged in
#      the first step of the algorithm.  Must be a sequence of equally-
#      spaced integers starting at 1.  The largest value must still leave
#      a sufficient number of bins to estimate entropy.
#  m : Vector of positive integers giving the window size for the entropy
#      calculations in the second step of the algorithm:  the number of
#      consecutive _bins_ over which similarity between subsequences is
#      of interest.  Typical values are 1, 2, or 3.
#  r : Vector of coefficients for similarity thresholds, such as r=0.15,
#      r*sd(y) must be in the same units as 'x'.
#      Averages in two bins are defined to be similar if they differ by 'r*sd(y)' or less.
#      NOTE: Currently only a single threshold is allowed per run; i.e.,
#      'r' must be a scalar.
#  I :  the maximal number of points to be used for calculating MSE


# VALUE
#  A data frame with with one row for each combination of 'tau', 'm' and 'rSD'.
#  Columns are "tau", "m", "rSD", and "SampEn" (the calculated sample entropy).
#  The data frame will also have an attribute "SD", the standard deviation
#  of 'x'. rSD = r*sd(y)

# SEE ALSO
#  'MultiscaleEn', which calculates MSE entirely in R.  It is more flexible
#  than this function (for example, it allows NA's in 'x'), but cannot
#  handle times series with more than a few thousand observations.
